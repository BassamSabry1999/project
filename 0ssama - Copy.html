<p class="pp"> There are many, many reasons <br>why learning a new language is a good idea.<br> It allows you to communicate with new people.<br> It helps you to see things from a different perspective,<br> or get a deeper understanding of another culture.<br> It helps you to become a better listener.<br> It even has health benefits, as studies have shown that people<br> who speak two or more languages have more active minds later in life!<br>

  Those are all reasons to learn any language <br>– but did you know that there are 6,500 languages <br>still spoken in the world today? With such an enormous number<br> to choose from, why pick English?
  <br>English is the international language of media and arts and so, <br>if you want to access as much as possible for yourself,<br> without relying on translations, <br>it’s the most powerful language you can learn today!

<p class="pp"> 400 million people around the world speak English as their first language.<br> Not only that, but English is listed as one of the official languages in more than a quarter of the countries in the world.<br> That’s a lot of new people you can communicate with just<br> by improving one language!
<br>This makes English one of the most useful languages you can learn.<br> After all, you can’t learn all 6,500 languages in the world,<br> but at least you will be able to communicate with people from all different countries using English<br>Companies are becoming more international, <br>and English is listed as an essential skill for more and more jobs.<br> There are some organisations that now conduct all their business in English,<br> no matter where in the world they are based. If you want the best paid opportunities,<br> learning English is a great idea.</p>

It even has health benefits,<br> as studies have shown that people who speak two or more languages have more active minds later in life!<br>As I said before, English is the world’s second language.<br> This means that learning English makes it much easier to travel <br>anywhere you want.For example, aeroplane announcements, <br>train timetables, emergency information and street signs are often translated into English,<br> particularly in countries that use a different type of alphabet countries Plus,<br> even if you don’t find other travellers or local people that speak your mother tongue,<br> you are practically guaranteed to find someone who understands some English<br>Most of the content on the internet is written in English.<br> Many of the world’s biggest news outlets, including TV,<br> newspapers, magazines and radio, are produced in English. Some of your favourite filmsproduced in English.<br> TV shows and pop music are probably English-language.<br> Go to any international film festival in the world and you will see that<br>all films are either in English or have English subtitles</p>
